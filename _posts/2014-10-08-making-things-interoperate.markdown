This article is about IPSO Smart Objects and interoperability. It was featured at the [Ericsson Research Blog](http://www.ericsson.com/research-blog/internet-of-things/making-things-interoperate/), you can read there the full version.

In Summary, last week we released the Smart Objects [Starter Pack](http://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/) the IPSO first draft on semantic Interoperability for the Internet of Things (IoT).

The document and XML objects specify a set of basic data models that can be used to define common IoT devices.
