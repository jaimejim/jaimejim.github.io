## O Bambino mio Divino

I write these lines as a way to cope with the treatment for my baby-boy born the Friday 19th 2021. Writing bits of text is one thing that seems to help me scape from this terrible situation for few minutes.

I would like for this entry to be a bit hidden from the blog posts, with an [inconspicuous title](https://youtu.be/HzU9vVK51-Y?t=23), so that mostly parents in the same situation find through the organic searchers. no point on traumatizing everybody. 

**Warning:** This text is not for the faint hearted. I tell a very painful and brutal experience. If you found this by chance, just stop reading.

## Tu scendi dalle stelle

My wife was pregnant of 9 months, the due date was the 24th of February. We live in Finland about 25-30 min ride by car to the maternity Hospital. We have a daughter of 20 months and the coming baby-boy had a perfectly normal development during pregnancy.

The tragedy happened on a icy cold Friday morning. My wife called the Hospital to mention that she felt a bit uneasy, the doctor recommended to go there and get checked. We arrived at around 9 am. I was told to wait outside as we have some restrictions due to covid on how many people can be inside.

As we have had a normal first child I never expected anything wrong to happen. I went outside and grabbed a coffee in a nearby Cafe. At around 9:30 I was told to go back immediately as they were preparing an emergency c-section on my wife. Apparently the baby had symptoms of distress due to an irregular heartbeat. It could be that the baby had hypoxia. The message was delivered in broken english, of which I mostly understood there was a big problem.

As I run to the Hospital I cursed the situation and my lack of knowledge of the finnish language. I arrived a couple of minutes later. I cursed the passivity of the personal at the time, and finally found a nurse who made me change into hospital clothing and go wait outside the operating room. My brain was in shock already and as the message was delivered unceremoniously and through a covid facemask I was a bit at a loss of what I was supposed to do. 

I saw Valentina, my wife, through the operating room small circular window. She was sitting sideways and being administered the epidural anesthesia. There were about 5 nurses/doctors and the room was well lit. Valentina was crying.

I felt the ground opening under my feet and a fear I have never felt before through the general confusion I was experiencing.

After few minutes I was told to get inside and sit at the head of the operation table. A green blanket covered Valentina's body from the waist down. I held her hand. She cried and blamed herself for the situation, which I barely understood at the time. I told her there is nothing to be blamed about, we have done every step in the right way. Nothing should be growing wrong and if something happened is definitely not her fault.

They took the baby away, mentioned again vague words about having had hypoxia. I did not know at the time what that meant, just a general idea of lack of breathing. I tried to ask for more information but they could not give many details at the time. Or maybe I just cannot remember. The conversations between the nurses where in finnish so I understood just few common medical terms here and there.

I was taken to another room where I believe they resuscitated the baby. A doctor, the only man I have seen in the Hospital up to that point, turned around and told me that there was an ongoing experimental study in the hospital and that there was a drug that could help my baby and whether *I would give my consent for my baby to be part of the experiment*.

Those are the most terrifying words I have ever heard. Even at that point I had little idea of what was happening, as the last hope of a normal birth faded the shock overcame me. I asked more information of what was happening and they explain that the baby had hypoxia and little or no blood flow went to his brain, likely causing brain damage. I didn't know it then but we had been very unlucky as it happens once every thousand births. So, so unlucky.

I consented to the drug - allopurinol - or its placebo and spent few minutes there. The baby was flaccid and the few signs of life were that it sucked a bit the finger and barely grasped. His feet did not move, no reflexes I could appreciate. A normal birth usually is noisy as the baby burst with life and anger to the world, crying scared. This poor boy did not move nor cried. I wept in silence. 

I still had not hold this poor baby in my arms. We followed the finnish custom of waiting a bit before naming babies, thus the little thing did not even have name.

I went back to the operation room and crying held my wife's hand. She already knew what was happening, better than me. I consoled her and tried to tell her that this things happen and lied to her and myself telling her things will be normal. 

## O Re del Cielo 

The hospital is a labyrinth and it has few different elevators going to different floors. The maternity ward, where the mother recovers from childbirth is on the 3rd floor. The baby was on the 6th floor in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). You cannot take an elevator from 3rd to 6th floor, you have to go down on the 5th floor and walk 100 meters every time, also ring a couple of bells every time and wear the mask at all times. Due to covid only one parent can be at a time in the neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU). 

The ICU has several rooms, ours is number 16. In it you may have up to two babies at a time and one parent per baby. When I got there I saw him intubated, with several cables and machines attached to him. Meanwhile my wife was being stitched on the operation room.

The baby weighted 3.4kg, was warm and almost did not move at all. At some point it cried but the tube through the larynx prevented any noise, his face was that of pain. I was actually relieved for a bit. Some feeling is better than no feeling. 

I was told the baby had a APGAR score (it stands for "Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration.") for 1,5 and 10 minutes was 2/3/5, that the umbilical pH value was 6.95, that the BE value was -14 and that the blood lactate value was 18.4. Few hours after birth we were told the S100B levels where >200. Those values now make some sense but when you hear them the first time they give little explanation. By the way, on the S100B it is more important the [rate of decrease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22592203/) than the initial value.
 
After the short oral consent and the tests, the baby started a hypothermia treatment, which lowered his body temperature to 33.5 degrees celsius. It seems that this is the only therapy available for babies with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE) unfortunately, cooling only helps approximately 1 in 8 babies with moderate to severe HIE. The treatment starts before the 6th hour after birth.

## E vieni in una grotta

The medical machinery the baby is in is constantly pumping and making noise. It is at first scary but after few days it gives some comfort that some precise mechanical artifacts constantly give the precise amount of everything to your baby. In my own words, the machines were the following.

There is first the Braun injection device, the baby has two of those. The device has 4 some pistons or injectors which are slowly and gently pushing the right amounts of the respective liquids into the various parts of my baby's body. Sometimes the nabel, sometimes the arm or the leg. One is for Glucose at 30% which is the food the baby needs in addition to the mothers' milk, they give him 3.5 ml per hour. They also give him heparin to prevent blood clots, they give him 1ml per hour through the nabel same thing on the arteria. Fentanil is also administered at 0.48 ml/h to control the blood pressure. 

There is another screen from Somanetics that has a graph monitoring the oxygen saturation of the brain, it was around 80-87 all the time. 

There are two big monitors that present the heart rate which was around 95-120 or so - due to the cooling process - , the oxygen saturation which was around 100, the blood pressure which was around 50 mmHg and the breathing pattern which includes apnea cycles, inspirations are about around 40-60 per minute, with rapid breathing.

There is a respirator from Dragger which I did not look too much in detail but that essentially helps push a little bit more of air into the babies. I was told the baby could breathe by himself but that they kept the respirator just in case during the cooling process. 

The cooling is achieved by means of another small blue box with little wheels that pushes air at 33.5 degrees celsius on pads around the babies body. The temperature is dropped slowly at around half a degree per hour and is later warmed at a similar rate. The skin temperature is measured with 2 or three sensors stuck on the skin and the basal temperature is measured with a small anal probe. As all parents know the baby expels the meconium, a tar-like poo that gets stuck to the skin. Cleaning everything is a fun activity.

There is also a computer with keyboard, mouse screen and camera that is attached to electrodes that go to the babies head. They don't go deep, don't worry. They take an electrocardiogram of the baby's bran activity it should be mostly regular except in times of very high excitement or seizures. The baby had one seizure the first night and everything went crazy with that screen. 
 
I was told there might be also seizures during the warming, but the baby can also be more relaxed as it is warmer, he will also be more awake hopefully.

The baby's bed is small and comfortable, it has a heating panel on top of it. The baby is changed positions every few hours to avoid skin marks. It has a couple of tiny tubes going down is nose and larynx to the stomach and lungs. The lung ones are for the respirator and to drain the lungs of liquid and amniotic fluid (hopefully not much after 24 h) and the stomach one is for the baby food. The respirator tube tends to accumulate liquid. Other than the glucose the baby receives few milliliters of dutifully pumped mother's milk. if you see the milk it looks yellowish as it has high fatty content. It just goes down by gravity into the babies tummy. He seems to like it. At some point I had to spread a bit of mother's milk on the lips, the baby reacted to it with a smirk.

What else... there is also a chair and another table with a computer and a specific software to write down details of the progress of the baby, it is called <https:/maisa.fi>. Nurses and doctors write there all the readings of blood tests and specific events of the child's time in the ICU. 

The room sounds like a server room, with the motors of the various machinery, and the ventilators cooling the many processors computing stuff in that room. 

This set up is on every room out of which there are 24 rooms I think. And the corridors connecting everything are labyrinthic. It is very easy to get lost as everything looks the same in the long grey corridors with the same masked nurses, white emergency doors and wooden ICU doors. 

The ICU floor is very clean and well taken care off but some of the parts of the Hospital seem run down and disorganized. For example I was told to use the stairs as they were reparing some floors and the elevator did not work. I couldn't get it again and after waiting and knocking I had to go all the way down to take an elevator, walk 100 meters, take another and go back where I was. I noticed all parents had trouble with these things.

## Al freddo al gelo

The emotional process of accepting the news is the worst experience of my life by far. I had a testicular torsion as a kid and I remember the excruciating pain, wanting to die to relieve it. I would happily and cheerfully suffer that for the rest of my life if I could have the peace of mind of knowing that my child's brain would be fine. The mind-pain is excruciating and superior to any physical pain.

When it starts, the process is that of grieving for the death of a healthy child - a child that never came - in addition to receiving the news that your baby is probably mentally disabled for life. There is no way to cope with it, no training I can think off and no advice I can imagine for those first few days. It is cruel, it is a surreal unbelievable nightmare. 

It is common to lose the appetite and lose several kilos in a matter of hours, thinking constantly at what could have happened and what may happen in the future. Thinking about the pain that this fragile baby born has endured, thinking about the figurative choking, the painkillers, drugs and catheters as well as the bleak future ahead for this child is excruciating. It lasts for days and as I write this lines, though not as intense, still lingers. I fear this will haunt me for life.

We were constantly crying. Back in our room I could only keep my mouth open making loud weeping noises. For minutes and hours. Thinking about my poor baby. Mi pobre hijo, en una camilla, drogado y frío. Un tesoro del cielo que tiembla inconsciente. Toda esperanza y toda fe perdida.

I thought about how perfect our life could have been had we arrived an hour earlier, perhaps only few minutes! The first morning I hold on to the hope that somehow things would be better. I had a constant deep fear un dolor profundo y hondo. Lágrimas y saliva se mezclaban en mi boca. Pero luego perdí la esperanza. No hay manera de expresar el dolor. La cara de piedra que se te queda.

At some point, when all hope is lost I prayed. I think that regardless of faith, creed or beliefs everyone prays to God in this situations, it is an entity rooted in ourselves that you try to awaken in extreme situations, a primordial entity. 

So you pray. We pray because there is absolutely nothing else on this world that can be done. I prayed more intensely than I ever did, I begged to God with a clean pure heart I sincerely offered everything I had, health, limbs and life for an improvement of the baby's condition. I cried my heart out. After extenuation, you may fall in a light sleep for few hours. This pattern goes on for at least few days.

## O mio Signore!

The happy life I remembered from barely few hours ago somehow becomes a bitter drink when being remembered, so the body learns not to remember. I prepared mentally for the worst, which is a child with cerebral palsy and dedicated care for his whole life. I am not ready to go into that yet, as we still do not know the extend of the injury. I know the statistics, that 1-4 in a thousand births suffer hypoxia, that half of those babies die and that if your baby is not on the "mild" hypoxia group he has small chances of a normal life.

Reading about the topic in this situation does not help. Normally the more information the better, and while I think it might be useful to know about the machines that help your baby and even about the medical terms, it is not good to enter the statistical realm. It feels like a mad lottery. It is better to focus on every moment, little by little. Focus on your wife/husband focus on finding some relief of the pain, take drugs if to relax you have to, force yourself to eat if you have to. Focus on your baby, talk to him, whisper words and caress him. I read him [Æsop fables](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/19994/19994-h/19994-h.htm), sang and told him what was going on.

If you have to know, please ask your doctor, I am just writing from the point of view of a suffering father, I am no doctor, no nothing. I just read literature I should not read in this situation. 

In all likelihood you too will have free time and will ignore this advice, cause you need to know what is going to happen. Perhaps you may have more stomach to read through everything. The highlights of what I learned are very grim.

The HIE classification uses three grades; mild, moderate and severe.
 
The outcome of babies with *mild* HIE is good (almost 100% of patients are normal at follow up), less than 5% of babies with *mild* HIE will have a severe handicap. This is the best possible HIE, which was probably treated during the [30 to 60 minutes after the injury](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25685948/). You can consider yourself lucky if you get this HIE.

The outcome for *severe* HIE is poor, I will write no more about it.

The situation is more complicated for babies with moderate HIE where the rates of poor outcome reported in the literature vary from 20 to 50%. With *moderate* HIE old studies of year 2000 about 52% of these babies have normal development the *first year*, the rest died or had serious impairment. This terrible statistic is disheartening but the studies don't seem very complete.

Other sources point out that about [40-50%](https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-019-1566-8) of the infants with moderate or severe HIE (i.e., 2500–10,000 infants per year in Europe) die or suffer from permanent and serious brain injuries.
Hypothermia applied at 6 hours after birth offers some protection but [the improvements are modest](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29067428/).

Aside from being life-threatening, Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) causes permanent brain damage. Once it is confirmed, there is no cure for it. Cooling only prevents further damage. It seems the brain does not really regenerate in any case. (Again I am not a doctor, I am just reading the literature)

There are also several [biomarkers](https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/308922/BIOMARKE.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) that may give you some insights on your specific situation, however as this is very rare, it is still relatively under study.

I could provide a detailed bibliography of the dozen papers or so I found relevant to my case, mention EEG, MRIs and other sources of information. However I really, strongly think it was counter-productive during the first days. So I will not do that. Sometimes is better not to know for a while. 

Besides talking or singing to your baby the second best thing you can do is to talk with your family and friends obviously. I spent ours on the phone as my family is in Spain. I spent ours hugging and crying with my wife. We had moments of rest in this short weekend, although it was mostly a long nightmare. There is nothing normal about it, your face will sometimes be numb from crying and other times when you tell what has happened you will become wobbly and fall apart. But you have to be strong and go on, you hear me? BE STRONG. You need to to do that for your family, for your baby. Be strong, look at the very short term for now and that is it.

Another thing that I have noticed may help, but that is counterintuitive is to postpone relaxation. We have a daughter and the first night I went home she was sobbing and crying for papa, not knowing where we were, wanting attention and care. It may seem a good idea to go back to your home from the Hospital but I think it is worse. It gives you an impression of normality, of hope and warmth that vanishes when you go back to the reality of the ICU. So I advice you to get a Hotel close to the Hospital and arrange to do turns with your wife. Leave job and other siblings aside for few days. Kids can recover rom having mum and dad away for few nights, but you should not be driving around distances in your current situation, moreover it will create an emotional rollercoaster that will tear you apart every time. If you have to do it, you probably should do it the first night, which is nightmarish, but I would not go back and forth for a week.

It also helps to think that right now there are dozens of family members and friends whose thoughts are with us in this. There are entire churches in Spain praying for my baby. I feel we are not entirely alone in this. Maybe I cannot emphasize this point enough, it is important that you open spiritually, cause it will *alleviare il dolore*.

It helped me to notice after hours of crying that the love for my wife, my daughter and my baby boy also increased. You will appreciate them more intensely. You will feel a lot more love for those closer to you. I think it is a natural compensation for the pain you are being inflicted. It gives strength to continue. 

## Io ti vedo qui a tremar

As I said at the beginning, I write this for multiple reasons:

To occupy my brain onto something. I spiral out of control into despair if I don't try to sail through the turmoil by doing something. For example writing. Alone I type and weep, type and weep.

To document what has happened and is happening, for myself mostly but perhaps it can be of use as a resource to other parents, even if gloom and doom is prevalent and if there is certainly little hope from this situation. Perhaps you can get some solace in knowing that you are not the only one, that this terrible path has been walked multiple times before by other anonymous suffering parents. Others like you were shocked by the circumstances and that they pushed forward the best they could. Perhaps you can get some advice, or perhaps I am only dropping you a bomb when you were just given the news. I sincerely hope for you, dear reader to never ever have to go through this. And if you are already in this nightmare, I hope you awaken from it soon.

*I wish for my baby to be healthy. I wish it with all my mind, body and soul at every level of my existence. I pray for him and for all babies in this situation. I pray for their parents and for their siblings and friends. God please help us.*
