It's been a couple of very hectic weeks and i have been completely obsessed with everything AI. Specially on the process of task automation with AI. I have been experimenting with AI image generation AIs, coding enhancing AIs, 5 different web APIs, my own server and half a dozen `npm` libraries that were completely new to me. Tooling in the AI world is very solid.

In any case, I am almost done automating a news generation site, so I will put a screenshot of how the output looks like. The prompting part is mostly OK but I still need to figure out if I can use Midjourney for the images, possibly through `discord.j`... let's see how this progresses.
