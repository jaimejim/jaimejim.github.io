Today we released the [IPSO Registry](http://ipso-alliance.github.io/pub) with all the objects done up to now. Using Github has been something I have been advocating for a long time. It will simplify development and tracking of new issues as they arise.

We already catch a couple of inconsistencies in the name of Resource IDs thanks to this. Few new projects have started using it as well ([BIPSO](http://bluetoother.github.io/bipso/#/)), Contiki...) and OMA-LWM2M is using it to fetch whichever new Objects are created.
