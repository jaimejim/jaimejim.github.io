This is my personal website, you can visit it at [jaime.win](http://jaime.win)

Test locally:

- run `multipass` and mount ubuntu.
  - You must have jekyll and ruby-dev there.
- run `bundle install`
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- open on browser on http://localhost:4000
- Do you want an admin panel to edit your posts? You can install this plugin `jekyll-admin`.
