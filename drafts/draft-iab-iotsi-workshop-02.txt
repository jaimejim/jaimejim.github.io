1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  The investigated topics often require coordinated
   efforts of many organizations and industry bodies to improve an
   identified problem.  One of the targets of the workshops is to
   establish communication between relevant organizations, especially
   when the topics are out of the scope for the Internet Engineering
   Task Force (IETF).  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
   complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
   groups of the IETF.

   Increasing interoperability in the area of Internet of Things (IoT)
   has been a top priority for many standards organizations and
   particularly the lower layers of the Internet protocol stack have
   received a lot of attention.  Also at the application layer, such as
   with CoAP and HTTP, there is a trend in reusing RESTful design
   patterns.  However, there are still many companies and organizations
   defining specifications that describe the same type of data.  This
   leads to interoperability problems.

   Thus, the IAB decided to organize a workshop to reach out to relevant
   stakeholders to explore the state-of-the-art and to identify
   communality and gaps [IOTSIAG], [IOTSIWS].  In particular, the IAB
   was interested to learn about the following aspects:

   o  The different perceived state of the art on data and information
      models.

   o  The lack of an encoding-independent standardization of the
      information, the so-called information model.

   o  The influence of the communication pattern, such as remote
      procedure calls (RPC), publish/subscribe or RESTful designs, on
      the deisgn of data and information models.

   o  Identifying which similar concepts groups have develop in
      parallel, especially those that would require only slight
      modifications to solve interoperability.

   o  Identifying how existing data models can be mapped against each
      other to offer inter working.

   o  Identifying common use cases for cooperation and harmonization.

2.  Terminology

   The first roadblock to semantic interoperability is the lack of a
   common vocabulary to start the discussion.  [RFC3444] does a start by
   separating conceptual models for designers or Information Models
   (IMs) and concrete detailed definitions for implementers or Data
   Models (DMs).  There are concepts that are undefined in that RFC and
   elsewhere, such as the interaction with the resources of an endpoint
   or Interaction Model.  Therefore the three "main" common models that
   could be identified were:

   Information Model (IM)
      It defines an environment at the highest level of abstraction,
      they express the desired functionality.  They can be defined
      informally (e.g. in plain English) or more formally (e.g.  UML,
      Entity-Relationship Diagrams, etc.).  Implementation details are
      hidden.

   Data Model (DM)
      It defines concrete data representations at a lower level of
      abstraction, including implementation and protocol-specific
      details.  Some examples are: SNMP Management Information Base
      (MIBs), W3C Thing Description (TD) Things, YANG models, LWM2M
      Schemas, OCF Schemas and so on.

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop             August 2017


   Interaction Model (IN)
      It defines how data is accessed and retrieved from the endpoints,
      being therefore tied to the specific communication pattern that
      the system has (e.g.  REST methods, Publish/Subscribe operations
      or RPC-calls).

   Another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload
   that some terms have.  Meaning will vary depending on the context the
   term is used.  Some examples of such terms are: semantics, models,
   encoding, serialization format, media types or encoding types.  Due
   to time constraints no concrete terminology was agreed upon, however
   work will continue within each organization to create various
   terminology documents, see [IOTSIGIT].

3.  Architecture

   Architectures follow different design patterns, some are REST-
   oriented with clear methods to find and manipulate resources on
   endpoints with almost no state kept between them.  Others are more
   Publish/Subscribe-oriented that focus on the flow of information
   based on the topics of the information that is being shared.  Others
   are RPC-like requiring to know beforehand the set of parameters that
   are accessed, requiring to generate code both on the client and
   server side, they are tightly coupled and service-oriented.

   Thing-hub-cloud
      things talk to a hub, which talks back to them and to the cloud.
      There is a spectrum of emphasis on the hub vs. the cloud.  For
      some the hub is simply an IP router that connects different link
      layer technologies, but for others it is a critical place for
      maintaining local control.

   Meta Thing
      some things are actually virtual, like an alarm composed of clock,
      lights, and thermostat.

   Nearby things
      some things may be geospatially related even if they are not on
      the same network or within the same administrative domain.

   Current data models and definitions for "things" often focus on
   defining actual physical devices and representing their state.  That
   focus should perhaps be shifted into a more holistic or user-oriented
   perspective, defining abstract concepts as well.  On the other a lot
   of focus is placed on human interaction with physical devices while
   IoT will be more oriented to interaction between "things" instead.

   Those things should be designed to be multiple-purpose, keeping in
   mind that solutions should be open-ended to facilitate new usages and
   new future domains of operation.  This pattern has already happened,
   devices that were intended for one purpose end up being used for a
   different one given the right context ((e.g. smart phone led light
   turned out to be a heartrate monitor).  IoT domain is currently
   missing insights into what user actually expect.

4.  What Problems to Solve

   The position papers submitted by various organizations, industry
   groups and individuals made clear that there is not a single aspect
   to be solved but rather a range.  At least the following goals have
   been described:

   o  Formal Languages for Documentation Purposes

   Standardization organizations are in the need for a more formal
   description of their information and data models in order to simplify
   review, and publication.  For example, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)
   used an XML schema [LWM2M-Schema] to describe their object
   definitions (i.e., data model) and the actual object definitions are
   available for download as XML instance documents.  These XML
   documents offer an alternative way of describing objects compared to
   the tabular representation found in the specification itself.  The
   XML files of standardized objects are available for download at
   [OMNA].  Furthermore, a tool is offered to define new objects and
   resources.  The online editor tool can be found at [OMA-Editor].

   o  Formal Languages for Code Generation

   Formal data and information modelling languages for use by developers
   to enable code generation.  For example, the Allseen Visual Studio
   Plugin [Allseen-Plugin] offers a wizard to generate code based on the
   formal description of the data model.  Another example of a data
   modelling language that can be used for code generation is YANG.  A
   popular tool to help with code generation of YANG modules is pyang
   [PYANG].

   o  Debugging Support

   Ability to allow debugging tools to implement generic object browsers
   by utilizing the standardized information and data model.  Example:
   NRF Bluetooth Smart sniffer from Nordic Semiconductor [nRF-Sniffer]
   can be used to display services and characteristics defined by the
   Bluetooth SIG.

   o  Translation

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop             August 2017


   The ability for gateways and other similar devices to dynamically
   translate (or map) one data model to another one.  An example of this
   idea can be found in [UDI].

   o  Runtime Discovery

   Allow IoT devices to exchange information, potentially along with the
   data exchange, to discover meta-data about the data and, potentially,
   even a self-describing interaction model.  An example of such an
   approach has been shown with HATEOAS [HATEOAS].

5.  Translation

   In an ideal world where organizations and companies cooperate and
   agree on a single standard there is no need for gateways that
   translate from one data model to the other one.  However, this is far
   from reality today since there are lots of proprietary data models in
   addition to the already standardized ones.  There are analogies with
   gateways back in the eighties when they were used to translate
   between network layer protocols.  Eventually IP took over providing
   the necessary end-to-end interoperability at the network layer.
   Unfortunately, the introduction of translation gateways that lead to
   the loss of expressiveness due to the translation between models
   seems unavoidable.

   Translation can happen in two flavours, namely:

   a) Translating data models: performs one translation between the data
   models once during design time, like translating a YANG model to a
   RAML/JSON model.  A single IM can be mapped to a number of different
   DMs.  b) Translating data between data models implies doing the
   translation at runtime.

   In a sense these distinctions affect as to when the translation is
   performed.  It can be done at "design time" when the information
   model is done, it can be done at runtime for a concrete data model
   and it can be done depending n the actual serialization.

   Yet another distinction will appear depending on the requirements
   from the application protocols, RPC-style ones might require a
   slightly different DM than REST ones for similar operations, for
   example SNMP-traps could be similar to CoAP-Observations but not
   quite the same.  It is easier to translate between systems that
   follow the same architecture/design pattern than across
   architectures, full translation might not even be possible (e.g.
   stateless vs stateful systems).

6.  Dealing with change

   A large part of the workshop was dedicated to the evolution of
   devices and server side applications.  Multiple of the participating
   groups have defined data formats for data representation, however
   interactions between devices and services and how their relationship
   evolves over time is more related to the interaction model.

   There are various approaches to it.  In the most primitive case, a
   developer will use a description of an API and implement whichever
   are the protocol steps.  In some cases the information model itself
   can be used to generate some of the code stubs.  Changes of an API
   imply changes on the clients to upgrade to the new version, which
   requires some development of new code to satisfy the needs of the new
   API.

   These interactions could be made machine-understandable on the first
   place, enabling for changes to happen at runtime.  In that scenario,
   a machine client can discover the possible interactions with a
   service, adapting to changes as they occur without specific code
   being developed to adapt to them.

   The challenge seems to be to define the human-readable parts as
   machine-readable.  Machine-readable languages require a shared
   vocabulary to give meaning to the tags.

   These type of interactions are based on the the REST architectural
   style.  Its principle is that a device or endpoint only needs a
   single entry point with a host providing descriptions of the API
   inband by means of web links and forms.

   By defining IoT specific relation types, it is possible to drive
   interactions through links instead of hardcoding URIs into the
   client, thus making the system flexible enough for later changes.
   The definition of the basic hypermedia formats for IoT is still work
   in progress, however some of the existing mechanism can be reused,
   such as resource discovery, forms or links.
