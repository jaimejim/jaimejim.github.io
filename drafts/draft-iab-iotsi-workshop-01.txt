1.  Introduction

   The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
   designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
   Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
   architecture.  The investigated topics often require of the
   coordinated efforts of many organizations and industry bodies to
   improve an identified problem.  One of the targets of the workshops
   is to establish communication between relevant organizations,
   specially when the topics are out of the scope for the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF).  This long-term planning function of
   the IAB is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed
   by working groups of the IETF.

   Increasing interoperability in the area of Internet of Things (IoT)
   has been a top priority for many standards organizations and
   pariticularly the lower layers of the Internet protocol stack have
   received a lot of attention.  Also at the application layer, such as
   with CoAP and HTTP, there is a trend in reusing RESTful design
   patterns.  However, data exchanged on top of these application layer
   protocols there is still a lot of fragmentation and the same degree
   of increase in interoperability has not been observed.

   Thus, the IAB decided to organize a workshop to reach out to relevant
   stakeholders to explore the state-of-the-art on 'IoT Semantic
   Interoperability' and to identify communality and gaps [IOTSIAG],
   [IOTSIWS].

   o  The different perceived state of the art on data and information
      models.

   o  The lack of an encoding-independent standardization of the
      information, the so-called information model.

   o  The strong relationship with the underlying communication pattern,
      such as remote procedure calls (RPC), publish/subscribe or RESTful
      dessigns.

   o  Identifying which similar concepts groups have develop in
      parallel, specially those that would require only slight
      modifications to solve interoperability.

   o  Identifying how existing data models can be mapped against each
      other to offer inter working.

   o  Identifying common use cases for cooperation and harmonization.

2.  Terminology

   The first roadblock to semantic interoperability is the lack of a
   common vocabulary to start the discussion.  There is a need to align
   between participating organizations on a common set of basic terms.
   [RFC3444] does a start by separating conceptual models for designers
   or Information Models (IMs) and concrete detailed definitions for
   implementors or Data Models (DMs).  There are concepts that are
   undefined in that RFC and elsewhere, such as the interaction with the
   resources of an endpoint or Interaction Model.  Therefore the three
   "main" common models that could be identified were:

   Information Model (IM)  it defines an environment at the highest
      level of abstraction, they express the desired functionality.
      They can be defined informally (e.g. in plain English) or more
      formally (e.g.  UML, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, etc.).
      Implementation details are hidden.

   Data Model (DM)  it defines concrete data representations at a lower
      level of abstraction, including implementation and protocol-
      specific details.  Some examples are: SNMP Management Information
      Base (MIBs), W3C Thing Description (TD) Things, YANG models, LWM2M
      Schemas, OCF Schemas and so on.




Jimenez, et al.           Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop           November 2016


   Interaction Model (IN)  it defines how data is accessed and retrieved
      from the endpoints, being therefore tied to the specific
      communication pattern that the system has (e.g.  REST methods,
      Publish/Subscribe operations or RPC-calls).

   Another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload
   that some terms have.  Meaning will vary depending on the context the
   term is used.  Some examples of such terms are: semantics, models,
   encoding, serialization format, media types or encoding types.  Due
   to time constraints no concrete terminology was agreed upon, however
   work will continue within each organization to create various
   terminology documents, see [IOTSIGIT].

3.  Architecture

   Architectures follow different design patterns, some are REST-
   oriented with clear methods to find and manipulate resources on
   endpoints with almost no state kept between them.  Others are more
   Publish/Subscribe-oriented that focus on the flow of information
   based on the topics of the information that is being shared.  Others
   are RPC-like requiring to know beforehand the set of parameters that
   are accessed, requiring to generate code both on the client and
   server side, they are tightly coupled and service-oriented.

   Thing-hub-cloud  things talk to a hub, which talks back to them and
      to the cloud.  There is a spectrum of emphasis on the hub vs. the
      cloud.  For some the hub is simply an access point; for others it
      is a critical place for control loops and ALGs.

   Meta Thing  some things are actually virtual, like an alarm composed
      of clock, lights, and thermostat.

   Nearby things  some things may be geospatially related even if they
      are not on the same network or within the same administrative
      domain.

   Current data models and definitions for "things" often focus on
   defining actual physical devices and representing their state.  That
   focus should perhaps be shifted into a more holistic or user-oriented
   perspective, defining abstract concepts as well.  On the other a lot
   of focus is placed on human interaction with physical devices while
   IoT will be more oriented to interaction between "things" instead.

   Those things should be designed to be multiple-purpose, keeping in
   mind that solutions should be open-ended to facilitate new usages and
   new future domains of operation. this pattern has already happened,
   devices that were intended for one purpose end up being used for a
   different one given the right context ((e.g. smart phone led light

   turned out to be a heartrate monitor).  IoT domain is currently
   missing insights into what user actually expect.

4.  What Problems to Solve

   Although the workshop focused on a specific problem it became obvious
   from the position papers that various organizations, industry groups
   and individuals attempted to solve different problems.  At least the
   following goals have been described:

   o  Formal Languages for Documentation Purposes

   Standardization organizations are in the need for a more formal
   description of their information and data models in order to simplify
   review, and publication.  For example, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)
   used an XML schema [LWM2M-Schema] to describe their object
   definitions (i.e., data model) as XML instance documents.  These XML
   documents offer an alternative way of describing objects compared to
   the tabular representation found in the specification itself.  The
   XML files of standardized objects are available for download at
   [OMNA].  Furthermore, a tool is offered to define new objects and
   resources.  The online editor tool can be found at [OMA-Editor].

   o  Formal Languages for Code Generation

   Formal data and information modelling languages for use by developers
   to enable code generation.  For example, the Allseen Visual Studio
   Plugin [Allseen-Plugin] offers a wizzard to generate code based on
   the formal description of the data model.  Another example of a data
   modelling language that can be used for code generation is YANG.  A
   popular tool to help with code generation of YANG modules is pyang
   [PYANG].

   o  Debugging Support

   Ability to allow debugging tools to implement generic object browsers
   by utilizing the standardized information and data model.  Example:
   NRF Bluetooth Smart sniffer from Nordic Semiconductor [nRF-Sniffer].

   o  Translation

   The ability for gateways and other similar devices to dynamically
   translate (or map) one data model to another one.  An example of this
   idea can be found in [UDI].

   o  Runtime Discovery





Jimenez, et al.           Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop           November 2016


   Allow IoT devices to exchange information, potentially along with the
   data exchange, to discover meta-data about the data and, potentially,
   even a self-describing interaction model.  An example of such an
   approach has been shown with HATEOAS [HATEOAS].

5.  Translation

   One of the targets of interoperability is to create translators
   between the data models.  There are analogies with gateways back in
   1985 when they were used to translate between network protocols,
   eventually IP took over providing interoperability, however we lost
   some of the features provided by those other protocols.  The creation
   of an equivalent "hub/s" that offer translation between the different
   data models or data semantics seems one of the ways forward.  Some
   lose of expressiveness due to the translation between models seems
   also unavoidable.

   When it comes to translation two different distinctions appear:
   translating data between data models and translating data models.
   The first one implies doing the translation at runtime while the
   second performs one translation between the data models one time,
   like translating a YANG model to a RAML/JSON one.  Indeed, for every
   IM multiple DMs could be translated.

   In a sense these distinctions affect as to when the translation is
   performed.  It can be done at "design time" when the information
   model is done, it can be done at runtime for a concrete data model
   and it can be done depending n the actual serialization.

   Yet another distinction will appear depending on the requirements
   from the application protocols, RPC-style ones might require a
   slightly different DM than REST ones for similar operations, for
   example SNMP-traps could be similar to CoAP-Observations but not
   quite the same.  It is easier to translate between systems that
   follow the same architecture/design pattern than across
   architectures, full translation might not even be possible (e.g.
   stateless vsstateful systems).

   Translation of models script to translate XML to YANG Translation of
   serialized data, on a hub in order to normalize it to other data
   model.

6.  Dealing with change

   A large part of the workshop was dedicated to the evolution of
   devices and server side applications.  Multiple of the participating
   groups have defined data formats for data representation, however




Jimenez, et al.           Expires May 18, 2017                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft          draft-iab-iotsi-workshop           November 2016


   interactions between devices and services and how their relationship
   evolves over time is more related to the interaction model.

   There are various approaches to it.  In the most primitive case, a
   developer will use a description of an API and implement whichever
   are the protocol steps.  In some cases the information model itself
   can be used to generate some of the code stubs.  Changes of an API
   imply changes on the clients to upgrade to the new version, which
   requires some development of new code to satisfy the needs of the new
   API.

   New, approaches imply that the whole interaction could be machine-
   understandable on the first place with changes happening at runtime.
   In it, a machine client can discover the possible interactions with a
   service, adapting to changes as they occur without specific code
   being developed to adapt to them.

   The challenge seems to be to define the human-readable parts as
   machine-readable.  Machine-readable require a shared vocabulary to
   give meaning to the tags.

   These type of interactions are based on the The REST architectural
   style. the principle is that the device or the endpoint, just needs a
   single entry point, the server would provide descriptions of the API
   inband by means of web links and forms.

   By defining IoT specific relation types, it is possible to drive
   interactions through links instead of hardcoding URIs into the
   client, thus making the system flexible enough for later changes.
   The definition of the basic hypermedia formats for IoT is still work
   in progress, however some of the existing mechanism can be reused,
   such as resource discovery, forms or links.
