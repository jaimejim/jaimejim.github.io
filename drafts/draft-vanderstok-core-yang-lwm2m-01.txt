              Mapping from LWM2M model to CoMI YANG model
                  draft-vanderstok-core-yang-LWM2M-00

Abstract

   This document defines a set of rules to convert a LWM2M xml-based
   device specification to a YANG MODULE.  The invocation of the server
   executing the converted YANG code makes use of CoMI.  The mapping
   from the original LWM2M uri to the corresponding CoMI URI is
   presented.

Note

   Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should
   be sent to roll@ietf.org.

1.  Introduction

   Standardization organizations define interfaces hosted by processors
   to manipulate the connected equipment.  Examples of such
   standardization organizations are BACnet, KNX, ZigBee, oBIX, OMA/
   IPSO, and many others.  These organizations plan to move to resource
   based interfaces.  The data models proposed by these organizations
   are hierarchical models that can be specified in XML and describe
   classes with attributes and operations that can be instantiated to
   objects.  An example is the OMA LWM2M (see [OMNA]) Object model, that
   standardizes eight numbered object types for device management.  IPSO
   (see [IPSO]) expands those objects to handle applications.  This
   document describes rules to translate xml specifications of the
   LWM2M/IPSO organizations to YANG [RFC6020].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6241] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  client

   o  configuration data

   o  server

   o  state data

   The following terms are defined in [RFC6020] and are not redefined
   here:

   o  data model

   o  data node

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020].

1.1.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   the YANG modules specified in this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is as follows:

      Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

      Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      data (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

      Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node, "!"
      means a presence container, and "*" denotes a list and leaf-list.

      Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

      Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Conversion rules LWM2M to YANG

   LWM2M objects are typed, where each type is identified with a number.
   The object provides one or more instances which are numbered.  An
   instance is composed of resources, also identified with numbers.  An
   instance on a host can be accessed with the example URI:

Internet-Draft                 LWM2M-YANG                 September 2016


   http://example.com/object/instance/resource, where resource, instance
   and object are numbers, specified by the LWM2M specification.

   When using YANG, the object identifiers, followed by the resource
   identifier, are YANG strings instead of numbers.

   For an automatic translation from the XML LWM2M specification to a
   YANG specification, the following rules apply for access, optional,
   units, and range specifications:

   o  The optional/mandatory aspect of the LWM2M resource is covered by
      the leaf's mandatory "false/true" statement of YANG.

   o  The R,W access aspects of a data item are translated using config
      statement.  Config "false" means R access, config "true" means RW
      access.

   o  When the YANG RPC is specified the E access is meant.  In
      [RFC6020] RPCs are modelled for NETCONF using YANG input and
      output parameters.  When input parameters are added, ER access is
      meant; when output parameters are added, WR access is meant and
      with both input and output parameters ERW access is meant.

   o  To specify the range of a data resource the YANG range statement
      is used.

   o  The YANG units statement is used to express the units.

   o  In the YANG specification the LWM2M resources are specified as
      leafs of a YANG list.  The YANG list is preceded by leaf called
      instance_number which contains the LWM2M instance identifier.  The
      instance_number is declared key in the YANG list.

   By modelling OMA objects as YANG lists, the numbered OMA object
   instances can be provided by assigning to each list object an
   "instance" key attribute.  The numbering of the instance does not
   need to be consecutive.  The OMA resources are the other leafs of the
   list object.  Consequently, the list element can be referenced by its
   instance number, as is the case for OMA instances.

   The YANG identifiers are strings and need to be mapped to numbered
   identifiers.  The appendices show 4 ways to represent the LWM2M
   device ID and resource ID in the YANG specification.

   o  In Appendix A, illegal YANG identifiers are represented as
      integers.  This approach cannot be compiled by YANG compilers.

   o  In Appendix B, Yang Identifiers are modelled as strings that start
      with string "ID" followed by the identifier number (see module
      humidityID).

   o  In Appendix C, Yang Identifiers of types and resources are
      modelled as strings that represent the type- and resource- name
      (see module humidityNM).

   o  In Appendix D, the device object is modelled as a container
      composed of an identifier and a list of instances.  The list
      instance is composed of an instance number and a set of resource
      containers.  The resource container is composed of the pair
      (attribute identifier number, IPSO resource specification)(see
      module humidityLF).

   Below the tree diagrams (see Section 1.1.1 for an explanation) of the
   three valid YANG modules are shown.

   Appendix D is the most complex one and is not recommended.
   Appendix A is impossible, Appendix B works but is a bit forced
   approach and lacks the resource name.  Appendix C is the most natural
   approach where the YANG identifiers are the device (type) and
   resource names.  CoMI uses the conversion from names to numbers to
   reduce the payload for the resource requests.  This conversion can be
   used for LWM2M type/resource names.

3.  URI convention

   The invocation URI of a LWM2M resource looks like:

   http://example.com/type/instance/resource

   In this section it is assumed that the YANG mapping of Appendix C is
   used.

   When YANG is used, the LWM2M resource invocation can follow the
   RESTCONF convention using http, or the CoMI convention using CoAP.

   When using RESTCONF the invocation will look like:

   http://example.com/type/instance=0/resource

   In the case of CoMI the type/resource name is converted to a numeric
   identifier to reduce the payload size.  The instance is specified in
   a query parameter.  Consequently, the LWM2M resource on a host
   containing a YANG specification is accessed with:

Internet-Draft                 LWM2M-YANG                 September 2016


   coap:// example.com/type/resource?keys=0

   Assuming that IPSO-humidity/Sensor_Value converts to 5700, the URI
   for the CoMI invocation of instance 0 of IPSO-humidity/Sensor_value
   will look like:

   coap://example.com/5700?keys=0

   For LWM2M types with only one instance, the keys=0 can be omitted.

4.  observation and notification

   Needs text

5.  YANG extensions to LWM2M

   In general, by adding keys leafs to a list object, YANG allows
   additionally the selection of instances by the contents of the key
   leafs.

6.  Security considerations

Appendix D.  YANG identifiers as additional leaf

   The device object is modelled as a container composed of an
   identifier and a list of instances.  The list instance is composed of
   an instance number and a set of resource containers.  The resource
   container is composed of the pair (attribute identifier number, IPSO
   resource specification).
