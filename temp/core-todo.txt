## Chairs Sync

* Have to prepare a long-term strategy for CoRE.
* Have to anchor CoRAL
* Start using ietf tracking tools better?
* how do we remove old drafts that have been updated? (draft-selander-ace-object-security-06)

## IETF Process

## RFC Editor Queue

* multipart-ct-04
* hop-limit-07: Writeup needed. Alexey asked why no mapping to http. @jaime

## IESG Processing

* resource-directory-23: In AD review. Revised I-D needed. RD-DNS-SD reference to the list @jaime
* echo-request-tag-08: needs to end call and shepherd writeup @cabo
* stateless-04: WGLC was taken, shepherd writeup TBD @cabo
* senml-etch-05: IESG's Roman and Adam DISCUSS. Authors to implement changes. Still few issues left. @cabo 
* senml-more-units-03: Waiting for auhors to provide update. 2nd registry conclusion. * topic to the list @jaime

## In/after WGLC

## Almost at WG last-call

* dev-urn-03: jari working on update. ABNF issue. Needs to resubmit. Then WGLC. We need to decide on shepherd as it is /// too, maybe it's small enough so that other /// employee can do it?

## Adoption Call

* draft-jarvinen-core-fasor-02: on WGA issued 29-11 @carsten
* draft-bormann-core-corr-clar: was there feedback on WGA? Take again to the list maybe?

## Active

* rd-dns-sd-05: Stalled for a long time and normative to RD. Authors to digest stuart's feedback.
* dynlink-10: To be finished and updated with CoRAL.

### Coreconf

* yang-library-00: No changes, authors find it ready for WGLC too.
* yang-cbor-11: Authors find it ready for WGLC.
* comi-08: refer to OSCORE as security mechanism. Authors finding it ready for WGLC (add NETMOD and NETCONF). only 4 people care for YANG.
* sid-07: Rob Wilson gave feedback on the 64b id Authors need to address it.

### Senml

* senml-data-ct-01: potential conflicts between “ct”
* draft-keranen-core-senml-base-prefix-00 (ipr #3662): need to look closer at use cases and find out how this is not a practical problem in LWM2M usage so far. This draft could be combined with Hannes’ draft; more analysis is needed.

### CoRE Applications

* href-01: moving forward.
* coral-01: moving forward. Examples added to other drafts.

* draft-fossati-core-coap-problem-00: The draft uses custom CBOR, but the information could also be mapped to CoRAL. More discussion needed.

* coap-pubsub-09: Proposal for update was discussed in Montreal; feature parity with existing -09 not yet reached. draft-hartke-t2trg-coral-pubsub-00 explores how CoRAL might be used for enabling publish/subscribe-style communication over CoAP.

### Group communications

* oscore-groupcomm-06: Authors see it as mature. Few reviews and few commenters.  After this round, might be ready for WGLC.
* tiloca-core-oscore-discovery-04: Reviewer volunteers are asked to provide reviews now. Also: The usual discussion of needing a registry for link target attributes (which is now possible according to the updated RFC 8288) ensued; Klaus might have a draft soon.
* tiloca-core-observe-multicast-notifications-01: New work first presented in Montreal; was revised with a simpler approach, which is could be summarized as the server redirecting a client to a multicast group by supplying a phantom request for that; this allows the server to choose a group and a token. In-room support, but probably needs more work, e.g., in congestion control. Need more reviewers now to make progress on this as a WG.
* dijk-core-groupcomm-bis-02: intended normative successor of (and obsoleting) RFC 7390 (dropping the experimental RESTful protocol that has not been picked up), with some initial reviews already addressed. In-room consensus to adopt as a WG document; to be confirmed on the mailing list. Then, before WGLC, we should ascertain implementation support for the whole breadth of the draft.

## Non-WG

* draft-tiloca-core-oscore-discovery-02: More reviews are needed in order to decide for WGA.
* draft-dijk-core-groupcomm-bis-00: WGA to be taken to the list. 
* draft-amsuess-core-rd-replication-02: at T2TRG atm.
* draft-amsuess-core-resource-directory-extensions-00
* draft-bormann-core-media-content-type-format-00
* draft-birkholz-core-coid-01
* draft-fossati-core-coap-problem-00
* draft-zcao-core-speedy-blocktran-00
* draft-tschofenig-core-senml-lbn-00
* draft-urien-core-racs-13
