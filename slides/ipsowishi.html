##IPSO Architecture

* The specifications aims to create a set of objects and resources that represent:
  * Fundamental concepts (i.e. temperature, on/off switch)
  * Single points of those concepts (i.e.  Min/Max Value, Current Value)
* Make those atomic pieces reusable accross domains.
* Make complex things by first aggregating those resources and then using composition.
* Intended for URIs, REST protocols. [Model in XSD](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/tech/profiles/LWM2M.xsd), [Objects in XML](https://github.com/IPSO-Alliance/pub/tree/master/reg/xml), serialized in JSON/CBOR/TLV/Senml...
* Others have used LWM2M/IPSO over MQTT ([LWMQN](https://github.com/lwmqn/mqtt-shepherd))

##Data Model

### Object Representation
  * Simple URI template:

  `Object ID/ Object Instance ID/ Resource ID.`

   ```
   3300  -> Temperature Sensor
   0     -> instance 0 of a Temperature Sensor
   5700  -> resource having the current value or a most recent reading`
   ```

  * All objects are registered with [OMNA](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html) where the LWM2M Management Objects also are. We also use the [IPSO Repository](http://ipso-alliance.github.io/pub/ ). More on that later.

### Data Types
  * Reuse those used by [OMA LWM2M](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_0-20170208-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M-V1_0-20170208-A.pdf).
      * String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Object Link, Time, Opaque, CoRELink.

???
Simple URI template defines the object, there is an ID for the Object ID which has a semantic meaning (3303 is temperature), and Resource IDs (attribute, 5700 current value). Together, "3303/0/5700" refers to the current value of temperature sensor instance 0.

All objects are registered in OMNA, which is where the management objects are. So you have both management and applicaiton objects under the same registry.

At the moment we also have some new registrations on the public IPSO repository, I'll talk about that later.

---

##Data Model

### Operations
  * Extends [OMA LWM2M](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_0-20170208-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M-V1_0-20170208-A.pdf).
      * R/W/X over resources, C/D over Instances, ...

### Content Formats
  * Specified by the [OMA LW TS 1,0](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_0-20170208-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M-V1_0-20170208-A.pdf), JSON, [CBOR](http://cbor.io) and [SenML](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-senml-05):
      * Resources: text/plain, tlv. Objects: text/senml+json, application/cbor...

### Application Protocol
  * The data model is agnostic of the protocol itself.
  * Observation is supported if the protocol supports it (e.g. CoAP Observe,  SNMP Traps, MQTT subscribe...), so do other operations.

## Sample Temperature Object

---

## Composite Objects

* As devices increase in complexity we can construct more complex objects by using Object Links instead of adding resources. That offers more granularity than a large nested object would (by observing the linked objects instead of the main one).

???

As devices increase in complexity (e.g., from a sensor to an appliance, from a switch to a complex fuel control actuator) the need to link resources to create more complex objects or ”Composite Objects” arises.

* A composite object can be constructed using Object Links. That offers more granularity than a large nested object would (by observing the linked objects instead of the main one).

---

## Reusability

* If the existing set of Objects is not sufficient for your needs, you can create your own by reusing existing resources.

* Current set of objects and resources can be found at:
    <http://ipso-alliance.github.io/pub/>

???

---
## Sample Implementations

* IPSO is supported by default by LWM2M, for example in Contiki,
[Leshan](http://www.eclipse.org/leshan/).

* Sample [C package](https://github.com/contiki-os/contiki/tree/master/apps/ipso-objects) for use of IPSO Objects in [Contiki](http://www.contiki-os.org).

* JS code templates of IPSO-defined devices [code templates](https://github.com/PeterEB/smartobject/blob/master/docs/templates.md). Each template gives a code snippet of how to initialize an _Object Instance_ with its `oid` and `iid`, and lists every _Resource_ the _Object Instance_ **may** have.

* Sample [Smart Objects](https://npm.taobao.org/package/smartobject) Class that can be used to create IPSO Smart Objects in your JavaScript applications.

* [BIPSO](https://bluetoother.github.io/bipso/#/characteristic) solves the probem of consistency and compatibility for BLE applications.

##Future Work on LWM2M + IPSO

 * **Low-hanging fruit:** Allign IPSO and LWM2M models, add versioning, same     data types, etc. Educate OMA folks in the fact that now we are responsible  for applications too, which are likely to use the same protocol and data    model.

 * **More ambicious:** Look into what other SDOs have been doing (i.e. W3C TD    and OCF) and try to converge, support a full featured RFC6690, use media    types for FETCH/PATCH...

##Q&A

## What do you work on?
* Domain: IPSO Objects are generic, both for the home or industrial domains.

* Coverage: Provide data model and basic semantics. No code generation, though third parties like [BIPSO](https://bluetoother.github.io/bipso/#/characteristic) have automatic C code generation for the objects. I do basic validation on travis [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/IPSO-Alliance/pub)

---
##Q&A

## How do you work?
* Vendors seem to be using what is available on device distros (i.e. Contiki, Mbed, RIOT). IPSO repository is very open right now, easy to build upon. We have also pushed IPSO in the various OS implementations.

* Traditionally both in IPSO and LWM2M work has been made through a committee. That is necessary only when defining the basic semantics and particularities of a model to achieve some consensus. Once that's achieved the work is more of a collaborative approach through the public repository.

* It might be necessary to have a staging repo and a production repo, the first one to do the changes in the group and the second towards the outside, where users can report issues.

* Adding new objects is trivial via a PR, we could add multiple validation/verification processes, comment oportunities, etc.

---
##Q&A

## How far did you get?
* V1 is on <http://ipso-alliance.github.io/pub/>, supports issue tracking, validation, etc.
* We do have only a simple data model, we don't have any of the W3C TD features like actions, properties, events.
* We also don't use the full features of RFCC6690 with more attributes and link relations.

---
##Q&A

## How is your work prepared to be part of a larger picture?
* As far as the repository, it's Open Source at the moment. It seems the right model as far as usage/processes are concerned.
* Lightweight coordination processes and more input from device manufacturer would be needed. For example, it was convenient to get feedback from the IKEA lights developer, Eclipse folks, etc.

---
##Q&A

## Opportunities for Collaboration
* Looking for device manufacturers/vendors input.
* Translation? Already work on translation LWM2M to YANG.

---
##Q&A

## How can Research contribute to the success of your work?
* Gaps in the technologies: takes time to add new features (i.e. data types), backwards compatibility will be problematic. At the moment it seems overspecified
* Simplicity and openness appears to be the key towards adoption.
* Research work on [Semantic Annotation](https://github.com/t2trg/wishi/blob/master/slides/semantic-patterns.pdf) will be usefull in future iterations of the IPSO Objects.

---
##Main point of this presentation...

* LWM2M 1.1  = IP + CoAP + Data Model + other (sec, linking, LPWAN...).
    * If you use IPSO and CoAP you are 90% there.

* Data Model = LWM2M Objects (spec) + IPSO (spec) + Others (non-spec)
    * Let's develop them as a single body of work.

* OMA is now responsible for management and *applications*.
    * Please get involved in the appication side too.

* First step, get feedback on issues in the existing Data Model. 
    * Please share your thoughts on the existing work <https://ipso-alliance.github.io/pub/>
