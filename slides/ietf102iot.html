##SUIT Hackathon

  * [IETF102 Hackathon](https://www.ietf.org/blog/highlights-ietf-102/)
    - 100 participants accross many IETF groups.
    - Presentations available at <https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf102-project-presentations>
    - Popular vote: [DNS](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf102-project-presentations/blob/master/dns_hackathon-presentation.pdf) won, [SUIT](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf102-project-presentations/blob/master/hackathon_presentation_suit.pdf) second ✌️

  Figure 1 shows the communication architecture where a firmware image
     is created by an author, and uploaded to a firmware server.  The
     firmware image/manifest is distributed to the device either in a push
     or pull manner using the communicator residing on the device.  The
     device operator keeps track of the process using the status tracker.
     This allows the device operator to know and control what devices have
     received an update and which of them are still pending an update.

Vulnerabilities in Internet of Things (IoT) devices have raised the need
for a secure firmware update mechanism that is also suitable for constrained
devices. Security experts, researchers, and regulators recommend that all IoT
devices be equipped with such a mechanism. While there are many proprietary
firmware update mechanisms in use today, there is no modern interoperable
approach allowing secure updates to firmware in IoT devices. In June of 2016
the Internet Architecture Board organized a workshop on 'Internet
of Things (IoT) Software Update (IOTSU)', and RFC 8240 documents various
requirements and challenges that are specific to IoT devices.

A firmware update solution consists of several components, including:
* A mechanism to transport firmware images to compatible devices.
* A manifest that provides meta-data about the firmware image (such as a
firmware package identifier, the hardware the package needs to run, and
dependencies on other firmware packages), as well as cryptographic information
for protecting the firmware image in an end-to-end fashion.
* The firmware image itself.

The demo shows:
1. the standard manifest file as specified by IETF SUIT WG.
2. the environment CLI installation in Mbed (or RIOT).
3. The encoding of the manifest in CBOR.
4. The signing in COSE.
5. The verification of the manifest in the device.

The device's bootloader verifies the firmware and boots with the new verfied image.

##SUIT Hackathon - What got done

<img width="350" align="right" src="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jaimejim/e0cdba60089bbeba9e84a2a8a79d628f/raw/0e30ad22adb8ce7f6965340d5d1f69a84057266b/board.jpeg">

  1. Set up development environment for use with new board on multiple OSs.
  MBed was used in this case. RIOT has the imeplementation of SUIT [in their roadmap](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/Roadmap). ✓

  1. Generate Manifest (JSON). ✓

  1. Encoding. ✓

  1. Sign it. ✓

  1. Verify on the device. ✗

  1. Detailed write up available <https://git.io/fNYC6>

##SUIT Hackathon - Lessons learned

* Making setup for 1st time users easier would be good. A preconfigured environment would be good. .red.bold[*]

* We need to use IDEs for debugging (i.e. [keil uvision](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/)) example project or software packs

* New development board works but we bricked 3 boards (potential issue on Macs).

* Getting to a small codesize for the bootloader will be difficult with CBOR and COSE.

* Parsing of CBOR encoded manifest is not straightforward.

* Manifest could use map instead of array for simpler parsing.

##CoRE WG

* Video Recordings: [Session 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2i9VAOJq8LU),
[Session 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0XfeVynCAY)

* [Slides](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-core-consolidated-slides/)

* [Raw minutes](https://etherpad.tools.ietf.org/p/notes-ietf-102-core?useMonospaceFont=true)

##CoRE WG

<img width="450" align="right" src="https://jaimejim.github.io/temp/core.png">

* Several on IESG review [cocoa](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-cocoa), [links-json](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-links-json), [oscore](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-object-security), [too-many-reqs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-too-many-reqs). No major issues on them, DISCUSS pending on OSCORE.

* SENML is now [RFC8428](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8428) 🎊

---
##CoRE WG

* [draft-ietf-core-object-security](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-object-security) is in IESG processing and is
  waiting for a review from Eric Rescorla, with a view to Eric
  clearing the remaining DISCUSS held on the document.  Technical
  Changes resulting from IESG and directorate inputs were discussed.
  Responsible AD Alexey triggered a second IETF last call to cover
  those changes.

* [draft-ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-oscore-groupcomm) is nearing WG last call.
Interop should be held before WGLC.

* [draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag) requires a few more reviews; no
  formal dependency but it would be good to finish this approximately
  on the same timeline as OSCORE.

---
##CoRE WG

* [draft-ietf-core-resource-directory](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory) was discussed, with some focus
  of the semantics of the incoming (registration) and outgoing
  (lookup) links.  With several implementations becoming available An
  interop would be next; **September/early October** time frame is
  envisioned. Next step then could be WGLC. Updates in the next CoRE interim.

* [draft-ietf-core-rd-dns-sd](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-rd-dns-sd) was discussed (and later presented in
  DNSSD WG as well).

  **Mapping CoRE Link Attributes to DNS-SD Record Fields**

  Much of the discussion centered about how the
  [rt= target attribute can be turned into a service type](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-rd-dns-sd-02#page-7) on the DNSSD
  side (Later in the DNSSD meeting, the question came up whether
  that is the right pairing in the first place.)

  All DNSSD service types must be registered (15 characters max); CoRE resource types can
  be registered (63 characters max) or can be URIs.  Further work on
  this is needed, as is on the pairing of ins= and DNSSD instance
  identifiers.

  Important: DNS labels are limited to 63 bytes in length and the entire Service
   Name may not exceed 255 bytes.

???

DNS SD used to locate nearby servers (i.e. printers), can be used with multicast.

---
##CoRE WG

* The CoRECONF cluster (new old name for yang-cbor
  draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor-06, comi draft-ietf-core-comi-03, and sid
  draft-ietf-core-sid-04) has recently received reviews fro the netmod
  community; a few more from the CoRE side and maybe another interop
  would be good before WGLC of this cluster, envisioned to close
  before IETF103.  draft-veillette-core-yang-library has a little more
  time.

  Steps towards new WG, **Yang Of Things (YOT)**.
  The CoRE WG is not the place to develop YANG modules that match this
  functionality.

* [draft-ietf-core-dev-urn](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-dev-urn) was presented, with a focus on the small
  changes needed for alignment with OMA LWM2M.  There was some support
  for this alignment in the room.  Jari Arkko will coordinate with OMA
  and report back.

* A quick heads up from Roman Danyliw pointed to the 2nd WGLC of DOTS
  signaling [draft-ietf-dots-signal-channel](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dots-signal-channel), which uses CoAP (found out during SUIT hackathon).
  Interested reviewers were found.

---
##CoRE WG

* [draft-ietf-core-senml-fetch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-keranen-core-senml-fetch) found a few reviewers.  Interest
  to be confirmed on the mailing list, in the case of success followed
  by a call for WGA.

  For stateless forward proxies, there was good interest to explore
  the option of introducing an extended token.  The plan is to realize
  (WGLC) or dismiss (revert to separate option, now also called
  Extended Token) before Bangkok. .red.bold[*]

* [draft-ietf-core-multipart-ct-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-multipart-ct) is ready for WGLC.  As the WG tends
  to think this will be successful, early registration of the
  Content-Format codepoint will now be pursued (following the
  procedure for this).

* [draft-bormann-core-proactive-ct-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bormann-core-proactive-ct) received good support.  Next step
  is WG adoption call on mailing list.

.footnote[.red.bold[*] Note: Separate extended token discussion internally in Ericsson.]

When a client registers to observe a resource for which no
representation is available yet, the server may send one or more 2.05
