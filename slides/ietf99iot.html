**WISHI Workshop**

  * <https://github.com/t2trg/2017-07-wishi/tree/master/slides>
  * Similar presentations as [IoTSI](https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/iotsi/), some progress done during the year.
  * Novel presentation about [iot.schema.org](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/1272), we have been involved in the drafting.
  * Interesting presentation about [WoT](http://jaimejim.github.io/slides/WISHI/05-WoT-wishi-2017.pdf), tries to be the "glue in-between" aplication and platform silos.
  * Interesting practical example [HyCoWare](http://jaimejim.github.io/slides/WISHI/21-Challenges-for-Semantic-LWM2M-Interoperability-in-Complex-IoT-Systems_WI....pdf)
  * Other SDOs (OCF, Fairhair, OMA, IPSO ...) also represented.

* [Yang of Things (YoT)](https://github.com/Ixau/yot/blob/master/ietf99/AggregatedSlides-Main.pdf).
  * Interesting for heavy on YANG companies.
  * [Translation OMA LWM2M to YANG possible](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-vanderstok-core-yang-lwm2m-00)
  * One single registry of SIDs to rule them all.
    * ☺ Novel, bold and concrete use of YANG for application data.
    * ☹ Like all other models, it needs broader support to work. Managing the SID registry might be unrealistic. Different angles (YANG people worry about development costs, IoT worry about RAM), technical challenges (version control, )

---

**CoRE WG**

* Interops were arranged for [Object Security over CoAP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-object-security).
  * Code available <https://core-wg.github.io/oscoap/>.
  * Interop results <https://ericssonresearch.github.io/OSCOAP/>
  * OSCoAP as an alternative to TLS/DTLS role is currently under debate at IETF.
  * New [multicast](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tiloca-core-multicast-oscoap-02) usage added.

* DNS-SD split in Resource Directory inprogress. The whole issue of **finding the RD** on the first place and normalizing discovery was brought up multiple times.<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-resource-directory>
  * LWM2M has a harcoded RD URI (LWM2M Server).
  * Multicast and reusing DHCP response is also possible.
  * DNS-SD part defines few attributes to describe resources in an RD to allow for internetworking with DNS service. No open implementation AFAIK.
  * OCF is looking into RD discovery over Wifi.

---

* As seen with YoT, YANG seems to be progressing, but outcome seems unclear. In particular it could be useful for really constrained environents like LoRA, NB-IoT or SigFox. They already have figured out a way to do compression so that they can fit a CoAP message in less than 20 bytes (!).
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-yang-cbor>
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-sid>

* <https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hartke-core-e2e-security-reqs> still under the radar to some and still an excellent document narrating use cases and security requirements for working with CoAP in proxied networks.

* <https://tools.ietf.org/html/core-coap-sms-gprs> should have more people from the operator side interested. Surprising (to me) the little participation, knowing that it is suposed to be used on LWM2M.

---

* Relatively big issue found with **CoAP over TCP** and specially with URIs in CoAP.
  * LWM2M and OCF will use CoAP over TCP and update their specifications accordingly but we will have to revert back to version since the current solution is unworkable with the mapping of coap to multiple transports (coap+tcp, coaps+tcp, coap+ws, coaps+ws, ...).
  * OCF solves that with ocf:// URI mapping at aplication.
  * Discussion an alternatives are available at [draft-thaler-appsawg-multi-transport-uris-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thaler-appsawg-multi-transport-uris-01) . New "all transports" **coap+at://** URI scheme has been added and details are being worked on. Target is to have one URI scheme that maps to multiple transports.
  * Interop to be arranged soon (ARM, Sierra W, us?).

<img width="700" align="middle" src="http://jaimejim.github.io/assets/images/coaptcpghi.png">

* [draft-amsuess-core-repeat-request-tag-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-amsuess-core-repeat-request-tag-00):  A CoAP server receiving a request may not be able to verify when the
   request was sent by the CoAP client. The draft presents a solution to both the lack freshness problem - by providing the "repeat" option as challenge - and the weak body correlation (when using block option) - by providing a way for a CoAP server to ask the client to re-transmit the request.

---

### Personal Takeaways

* Interesting to see experiences with LWM2M and CoAP from elsewhere. Similar issues reported.
* RIOT-OS community is currently [saturated with PRs](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/pulls).
* We had a meeting with the chairs of the [HTTP WG](http://httpwg.org/). No conflict due to extension of HTTP to the *constrained* space. Interest on CoAP over QUIC.
* The data model research space is getting very researchy at times. IMO Actual deployments will make the difference rather than the overarching best data model.
* Conflict between OSCoAP and DTLS we are not to take any more drafts that use OSCoAP for a while.
